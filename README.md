# üìù What is this?
This repository houses the code for the Fiveable Discord server network's "anonymous" message posting bot. The original intention for this bot was for it to be used during Pride Month, allowing people to ask questions without exposing their identities.

The bot allows people to **DM** it with the messages they wish to send in. It also allows moderators to set a log channel in their server where they get notifications as to who sends in which messages, with the expectation that they will stay confidential.
